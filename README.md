# Hangman
This is a small Hangman Game I made to practice core Java concepts

The game implements basic Java concepts such as if-else and for loops to do things like:

> Display a stick figure whose appendages vanish with each wrong answer ( Gruesome, I know ): )
> Ability to integrate multiple themes of words. Currently there are animals and birds.
> You can play the game infinitely with a unique word each time.
> The game difficulty can be adjusted.

Thank you for reading!
